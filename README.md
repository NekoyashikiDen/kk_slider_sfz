# KK Slider Samples and SFZ files to be used in music making


Realized I wasn't the only one that was having problems with the KK Slider Soundfont with  SForzando. So I took the time to pull out all the vocal kk slider samples, beatbox and guitar samples from the soundfont and make the SFZ patches. 

# The Samples

All samples are ACIDIZED and have root key attached, Each sample is labeled with the Key as well incase that doesn't work. included are SFZ patches for every sample

The only samples that are not ACIDIZED are the Guitar patch sample and the beatbox ones. 

# Using With Sforzando

Drag and drop the SFZ files onto an Sforzando instance


# Directwave

The Directwave File is used for FL Studio Directwave. Each vocal part is assigned to a midi channel which can be accessed with the note colors in FL
