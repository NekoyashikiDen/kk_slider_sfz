# kk_slider_sfz
An updated version of the KK Slider soundfont using SFZ as the sampler

Realized I wasn't the only one that was having problems with the KK Slider Soundfont with  SForzando. So I took the time to pull out all the vocal kk slider samples and guitar samples from the soundfont and manually make the SFZ patches. 

All samples can be used in a sampler but included are SFZ patches for every sample
